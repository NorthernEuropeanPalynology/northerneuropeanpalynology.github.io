            <h1>Automated Pollen Classification</h1>

            <p>
                The most pivotal step towards automated palynology represenents the classification of individual pollen grains. Over the last three decades, there
                have been tremendous changes in the structure and accuracy of such "classifiers":

                "Two decades ago, automated classification primarily relied on text and feature-based classifiers. 
                These traditional methods processed data by extracting handcrafted features or using statistical techniques to analyze text or numerical data. 
                However, they often struggled with complex, high-dimensional data like images. 
                CNNs revolutionized automated classification, particularly in image recognition, by enabling the automated extraction of relevant features directly from raw data. 
                This departure from handcrafted features marked a significant advancement, as CNNs process visual data through layers of interconnected neurons, 
                mimicking the visual cortex's organization in animals. This breakthrough in deep learning significantly improved classification accuracy and efficiency, 
                leading to widespread adoption in various fields."

                On this page we would like to give an overview over the past advancements in classification capabilities for pollen analysis and employ some publicly
                available models for test purposes.

            <li>In <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108521">von Allmen et al. (2024)</a> we trained a model to recognize 9 pollen types from fossilized archives that are important to register important major
                vegetation change for this period. You can test the model on your own custom images <a href="./vonAllmen.html">here</a>. For reference, the model was trained on acetolyzed lake sediment 
                samples, dyed wtih safranine.
