    <h1>Object Detection</h1>
    <p> Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame. 
        It involves not only recognizing what objects are present but also drawing bounding boxes around them to outline their locations. 
        On the other hand, segmentation goes a step further by precisely delineating object boundaries, providing pixel-level accuracy in 
        identifying object shapes within an image or video. Different studies have suggested solutions for microscope images and we 
        would like to give you an overview for the most recent advancemnets.
