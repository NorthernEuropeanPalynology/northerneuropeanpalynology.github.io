    <h1>Object Detection</h1>
    <p> Object detection is the process of identifying and locating objects within an image or video frame.  
        In contrast, segmentation goes a step further by precisely delineating object boundaries, providing pixel-level accuracy in 
        identifying object shapes within an image or video. Different studies have suggested solutions for the detection or segmentation of
        pollen grains and non-pollen palynomorphs and we try to implement these algorithms based on the same methodological approach.

    <h2 style="margin-left: 5%;">Pollen segmentation based on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13575">Ola Olsson et al. (2021)</a></h2>

    <p>
    We replicated Ola Olssonâ€™s pollen grain segmentation algorithm from their 2021 study using both Octave and MATLAB. 
    The Octave script (<a href="https://github.com/NothernEuropeanPalynology/Tools/tree/3af0f8eff0b75c697bd812c93c2e2b05ba628b86/pollen_segmentation_Ola%20Olsson">
        Octave script</a>) faithfully mirrors the original method, ensuring compatibility for researchers using open-source platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
    Additionally, we developed a user-friendly MATLAB application tailored for segmenting pollen grains in microscopy images. 
    This application streamlines the process, offering an intuitive interface coupled with the robust computational capabilities of MATLAB. 
    By providing both open-source scripting and a dedicated application, we aim to enhance accessibility and reproducibility, empowering researchers 
    to get used to digital microscoping.

    <p>
        In a previous study by <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.quascirev.2024.108521">von Allmen et al. (2024)</a>, we published code that we have since adapted and transferred to TensorFlow.js, 
        a library for machine learning in JavaScript. This code has now been integrated into this HTML webpage, enhancing its accessibility for web-based applications.
        <br>
        Utilizing TensorFlow.js allows the machine learning functionalities to run directly in web browsers, eliminating the need for server-side computations. 
        This integration not only showcases the versatility of the published code but also opens avenues for interactive and user-friendly machine learning applications on the web.
